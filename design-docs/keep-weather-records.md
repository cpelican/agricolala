# Keep weather records


## Context
We find it difficult to be able to advise users which treatment they might be needing.
We were thinking a model of diseases prediction might be useful
Until now each time a user is creating a treatment, they also write in the db which disease they are fighting
If we had the weather data along with the current active diseases this could be helpful


## Actions
We need to keep the records of weather data for each parcel somewhere.
Ideally it might be interesting to divide the data by zone, but we are not sure how to do this.
